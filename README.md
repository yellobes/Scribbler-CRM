Scribbler CRM
=============

..is a CRM / Object cache that is generic enough that it should be able to handle most basic CRM needs. It's geared towards hackerspaces / makerspaces that want to bolt on extra stuff, like client boxes that do RFID door key auth, 3d printer usage accounting, and membership while tying all of that to billing.
